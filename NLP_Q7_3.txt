College football recruiters have their GPS devices powered on as they begin visiting high schools to evaluate players over the next month. Let me provide a few suggestions on players who have been overlooked so far. Maybe they don't fit a height-weight requirement. Maybe they were injured last season. Maybe they don't participate in seven-on-seven all-star passing tournaments. Maybe they play multiple sports. Whatever the reason for not receiving early buzz, these players will be standouts in the fall, and it's far more relevant how someone performs in a real game compared with how they look running around a red cone.
