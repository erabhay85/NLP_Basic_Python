Also called saloon, a sedan is a type of passenger car that usually has a three-box configuration with pillars simply identified as A, B, and C. It is composed of three major compartments namely cargo, passenger, and engine.

Regarding the passenger compartment, it includes two rows of seats. It makes sure that there is enough space in the rear passenger compartment for adults. Meanwhile, the cargo compartment is usually at the back, except for cars such as the Chevrolet Corvair, Volkswagen Type 3, Tatra T613, and Renault Dauphine. The reason? These specific vehicles have their engines in the rear.

Interestingly, battery electric liftbacks like the Tesla Model S do not have a compartment for the engine. Instead, they tend to have front and rear cargo compartments. The rear compartment can even be reserved for more passengers, not just cargo.

To make things more interesting, let's provide more answers to the question "What is a sedan?" by including the major variations of this car.
