According to radar data from the agency's SELENE lunar orbiter, published Thursday in Geophysical Research Letters, the chasm is less than 330 feet beneath the surface and around 300 feet wide dimensions that could comfortably house inhabitants. Other lava tubes were hinted at by the presence of skylights, or areas where the roof of the tube has collapsed, exposing it to the surface above. It's not yet known how many such skylights exist for this cave.

Lava tubes formed billions of years ago when the moon was still geologically active and molten rock gushed from beneath the surface. Vast lava plains today still mark the moon's surface, and tunneling through them are channels where lava once ran. In some cases, the lava subsided, leaving a hollow chamber behind. These are similar to the lava tubes found on Earth, and many still exist on the moon.
